# First Order Reliability methods

Here is possible to find the optimization codes I wrote for computing the reliability index and the failure probability for any limite state function. 

There is, initialy, 3 files: 
*  **[FORM_SQP.m](https://github.com/iagolemos1/First-Order-Reliability-methods/blob/master/FORM_SQP.m)**: The most general code, it solves, prior, any limit state function, implicit or explicit, for normal variables. It uses the Sequential Quadratic Programming solver from MATLAB optmization tool.
